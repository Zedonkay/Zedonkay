## Hi 
I'm Ishayu Shikhare, an ECE undergrad at Carnegie Mellon University minoring in Artificial Intelligence 

I’m particularly interested in:

- Learning-based control and sim-to-real transfer 
- Robotics tooling for embedded + GPU-accelerated systems 
- Simulation and software infrastructure for autonomy
- Bringing research ideas into real-world deployment
