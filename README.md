## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ishayu Shikhare, an incoming 3rd year at Carnegie Mellon University, passionate about robot control and tackling challenging problems. 

I've explored these interests through research at the **Biorobotics Laboratory** and as part of the **Carnegie Mellon Racing Driverless Controls Subteam**. I'm currently learning more about CUDA and am always interested in solving hard problems, especially those at the intersection of robotics, control, and computation.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or chat!
