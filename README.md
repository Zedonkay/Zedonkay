## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Ishayu Shikhare â€” an ECE undergrad at Carnegie Mellon University with minoring in Artificial Intelligence and Discrete Math. 

Iâ€™m particularly interested in:

- Learning-based control and sim-to-real transfer 
- Robotics tooling for embedded + GPU-accelerated systems 
- Simulation and software infrastructure for autonomy
- Bringing research ideas into real-world deployment
